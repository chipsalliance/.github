[The CHIPS Alliance](https://chipsalliance.org/) develops high-quality, open source hardware designs and tools relevant to ASICs and FPGAs. By creating an open and collaborative environment, CHIPS Alliance shares resources to lower the cost of development. Companies and individuals can work together to develop open source CPUs, various peripherals, and complex IP blocks, as well as open source hardware or software tools to accelerate the creation of more efficient and innovative chip designs.

----

The CHIPS Alliance hosts multiple open source [Projects](https://www.chipsalliance.org/projects/), which are [Workgroups](https://chipsalliance.org/workgroups/).
